            Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist best known for developing the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics.
            His equation, E = mc², has become one of the most famous equations in history. Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921
            for his discovery of the photoelectric effect, which was pivotal in establishing quantum theory.

            Beyond his scientific achievements, Einstein was also known for his humanitarian efforts and advocacy for civil rights and world peace.
            His curiosity, imagination, and relentless pursuit of knowledge continue to inspire scientists and thinkers worldwide.

            "Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination encircles the world."
